# Lab 8 â€“ DER Protection with IEEE 2030.5 and Firewalls

## Overview
This lab will introduce some methods of protecting DER networks and devices from cyberattacks. Here we show the value of using encrypted communication protocols and setting up host-based firewalls. 

## Goal 
The first goal is to show the value to encrypting communications between the DER and DERMS.  Another is to introduce students to the IEEE 2030.5 protocol and associated schema.  Last the students will see first hand the impact that firewall rules have on access to DER systems. 

## Prerequisites

Windows DERMS Machine:  
	- IEEE 2030.5 Server
	- Wireshark

Kali Linux VM:  
	- SSH to DER device
	- Mozilla Firefox
